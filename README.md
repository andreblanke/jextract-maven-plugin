# jextract-maven-plugin

[![License][1]](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
[![Maven Central][2]](https://search.maven.org/artifact/dev.blanke.maven.plugins/jextract-maven-plugin/1.1.0/maven-plugin)

A Maven plugin to enable the execution of Project Panama's [`jextract`](https://github.com/openjdk/jextract) tool as
part of a build, allowing the generation of Java bindings from native library headers.

## Requirements

- [Project Panama Early Access-Access Builds](https://jdk.java.net/panama/)
  - While the plugin can be built using JDK 17 and newer, the early access build must be used to invoke Maven so that
    the plugin can find the `jextract` [ToolProvider][3]. Make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
    accordingly and follow the steps in the [Allowing access to `jextract`](#allowing-access-to-jextract) section.
- [LLVM >= 9](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

## Usage

### Allowing access to `jextract`

Because `jextract` is still in the incubation stage, the JVM used to run Maven must be explicitly configured to resolve
the `jdk.incubator.jextract` module and to allow native access from it. This is accomplished using the below
command-line arguments:

```text
--add-modules jdk.incubator.jextract --enable-native-access jdk.incubator.jextract
```

To pass these arguments to Maven you can use either the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable or the `.mvn/jvm.config` file
which should be located in your project's top-level directory.

See https://maven.apache.org/configure.html for more details on configuring Maven and
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/11 for why this is necessary.

These steps will no longer be necessary once `jextract` has left the incubation stage.

### Configuring the plugin

The plugin can be used like any other Maven plugin by adding it to the `plugins` block of your project's `pom.xml` and
defining an execution of the `jextract` goal:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>dev.blanke.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>jextract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
  <configuration>
    <!-- "header" is the only required configuration element. -->
    <header>...</header>
    <!--
      You may wish to change the target package that contains the generated bindings,
      which otherwise defaults to "${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}".
    -->
    <package>...</package>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>jextract</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>jextract</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

If your Maven project consists of more than native bindings, it is recommended to keep the executions of the plugin
in a separate Maven module upon which the other modules depend.

The configuration elements exposed by the plugin mostly correspond to the command-line arguments,
the only exception being the `--source` argument of `jextract` which is specified implicitly.
This forces the tool to generate Java code instead of compiled `*.class` files and allows the compilation to be
customized  using the `maven-compiler-plugin` (as opposed to using the internal in-memory compiler `jextract` would
use without the `--source` flag).

Generated sources will be placed in the `${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/jextract` directory
(which should usually be `target/generated-sources/jextract`). The output directory can be changed using the
`<outputDirectory>...</outputDirectory>` configuration element. It is automatically added as compilation root.

Because the generated Java source code makes use of the `jdk.incubator.jextract` module, the `maven-compiler-plugin`
must be instructed to allow access to the module:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.8.1</version>
  <configuration>
    <source>19</source>
    <target>19</target>
    <compilerArgs>
      <arg>--add-modules</arg>
      <arg>jdk.incubator.jextract</arg>
    </compilerArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```
